<h2> Intro</h2>
<p> Somtimes there is a need to sync execution of two standalone applications<br>
there are quite a few solutions on how this can be done.<br>
but a very simple solution is using the Linux signaling system, there<br>
are quite a few limitations of using this solution, but considering a very simple situation where one application just wants to announce it's state to the other.<br>
i.e. application state can be converted it to a simple int value, the following example can become a very simple method on doing this<br>
