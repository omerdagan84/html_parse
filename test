h1 simple HTML editing script
h2 Intro
p
well, since I started woking on this page, I noticed that writing HTML tags pisses me off
It's annoying. Since I don't like to be annoyed I figured I will write a small script to ease writing HTML code.

p
obviouslly, I am not going to write a hugh program to actually handle the entire language restrictions. there are enough IDE to handle writing and managing HTML code.
No, I just want to be able to write the textual parts of the page easily, so I don't need to hang on writing all the tags when writing.

h2 the script
p
h3 definitions
As a starting point i decided to support easy writing of just a few textual tags
i.e. p, h1, h2, h3, ul and li.
The idea is being able to write naturally as possible and letting the script parse the text file and create the needed tags
I decided on the most easy to implemnt method, a simple line based parsing where each line will be:
PARAM text content
where PARAM is
ul
li p - a start paragraph definition
li h1 - a header-1 definition
li h2 - a header-2 definition
li h3 - a header-3 definition
li ul - an unordered list definition
li li - a list item

p
h3 design restrictions
the script should be able to support multi-line paragraphs
the writing should remain as natural as possible

p
h3 the script
the script is based on <b>read</b> and a simple string <b>case</b>

p
h3 GitHub link
the link should be here

p
h3 the code explained

h1 this an h1 header
h2 this is an h2 header
p this test for paragraph
should support mutline
h2 and sub headers

p this should be a second paragraph
h2 with a sub header
and text
h2 a sub message
and text

p
ul
li a list item
li another list item
li and a third
